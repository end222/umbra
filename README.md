# Umbra
## What is Umbra?
Umbra is an AUR helper for Arch Linux which is written in Ruby

## Why another AUR helper?
Umbra exists mainly because I wanted to make a more serious programming project mainly to practice and improve. I do not have any particular reason why it is better than other AUR helpers.

The main difference is that Umbra is written in Ruby, a language that I really like and, as far as I know, hasn't been used in other helpers so I wanted to see how it resulted.

## Features
* Written in Ruby
